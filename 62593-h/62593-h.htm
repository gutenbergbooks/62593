  <h2 class='c005'>THE PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Art supervisors in the public schools assign picture-study
work in each grade, recommending the study of certain pictures
by well-known masters. As Supervisor of Drawing I found
that the children enjoyed this work but that the teachers felt
incompetent to conduct the lessons as they lacked time to look
up the subject and to gather adequate material. Recourse to
a great many books was necessary and often while much information
would usually be found about the artist, very little
was available about his pictures.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hence I began collecting information about the pictures
and preparing the lessons for the teachers just as I would
give them myself to pupils of their grade.</p>

<p class='c011'>My plan does not include many pictures during the year,
as this is to be only a part of the art work and is not intended
to take the place of drawing.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lessons in this grade may be used for the usual drawing
period of from twenty to thirty minutes, and have been successfully
given in that time. However, the most satisfactory way
of using the books is as supplementary readers, thus permitting
each child to study the pictures and read the stories himself.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>Questions to arouse interest.</b> Where is
this dog? Why do you think so? Does he
seem to be looking across the water, or toward
the land? What kind of dog is he? How do
you know he is lying in the sunshine? What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>does the length of the shadows tell us about
the time of day? What could this dog do if
there should be a severe storm on the water?
Can you see anything in the picture that makes
you think there may be a storm coming? Where

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the picture.</b> One day when
the artist, Sir Edwin Landseer, was visiting in
the fine home of his friend, Mr. Newman Smith,
a great Newfoundland dog came into the room
carrying a basket of flowers in his mouth. Sir
Edwin Landseer thought he had never seen so
large and fine a dog, and when the dog came up
to him and offered him the basket of flowers,
as his owner told him to do, he was delighted.
Being very fond of animals, Landseer always
thought of painting them, so he suggested that
he paint a picture of this dog. Mr. Newman
Smith must have been surprised, for every one
knew Sir Edwin Landseer had so many animals
to paint that he kept a long waiting list, and
it was usually many weeks before he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>commence a picture. But the artist could not
forget the kind, intelligent eyes of this handsome,
trusty, powerful dog, and in a few days
he sent for him. So Paul Pry—for that was
the dog’s name,—was taken to Sir Edwin
Landseer’s studio.</p>

<p class='c011'>The way to the artist’s house led through a
beautiful park, called Regent’s Park, and then
along the road called “St. John’s Wood Road.”
The house was small but behind it was the
garden, and at the end of the garden was what
had once been an old barn. This barn had
been made over until, with its many windows
and fine view of the country all round, it had
become an ideal place for a studio.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul Pry remembered Landseer at once, as
anyone could see by the way he went up to
him, wagging his tail and offering his paw.
He did exactly as he was told, and seemed to
understand perfectly everything that was said.
He was a beautiful animal, and Landseer could
not help thinking how strong such dogs are
and what wonderful things they can be trained
to do. Perhaps the first thing he thought of
was how they save people from drowning, for
they are very strong swimmers and can save
lives when men are unable to do anything.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Edwin Landseer painted a picture of
another dog that looked enough like this one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>to be Paul Pry himself. He called the picture
“Saved,” because the dog has just saved a
little child from drowning.</p>

<p class='c011'>In that picture the dog is seen lying on the
shore, too exhausted to do anything more than
wait for help. He has strained every nerve and
risked his own life to bring the child to land.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Edwin called Paul Pry and told him to
jump up on a big table where he could see him
better. Then as he painted, he seemed to see
the dog lying on the edge of a pier or wharf,
waiting to go to the rescue if some one should
need him.</p>

<p class='c011'>So in this picture we see Paul Pry lying on
the stone wharf while the water comes lapping
gently against the iron mooring ring to which
boats are fastened. It must be at the highest
point of the tide, for we are sure the water
never rises high enough to cover that iron
ring entirely.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just now the sun is shining brightly. We
can tell this by the shadow of the dog’s great
dark head on the white coat of his body. The
length and direction of the shadows tell us
that the sun must be high in the sky. If it
were low in the horizon the shadows would be
longer. We can be sure of this by watching
our own shadows as we go home from school.
The few sea gulls circling near the shore call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>our attention to the sky, where the clouds
are just beginning to gather, as if a storm might
be approaching. Perhaps the good dog has already
scented the storm, and is quietly waiting
to see if there is any work for him to do. His
ears, slightly lifted, show us that he is attentive
and watching.</p>

<p class='c011'>It must be a quiet, warm day or Paul Pry
would not look so comfortable lying on such an
exposed end of the pier. Perhaps the air is
sultry, as it often is before a storm, for the
dog’s tongue hangs out and you can almost
hear him pant.</p>

<p class='c011'>This brave old dog, so ready and willing to
risk his life to save other lives, might have been
called “A Distinguished Member of the Life-Saving
Crew,” but Sir Edwin Landseer knew
his dog would be as brave on land as on the sea,
so he used the name “Royal Humane Society,”
which may include both.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the painting was finished it was placed
on exhibition and hundreds of people came to
see it. The owner of the dog, Mr. Newman
Smith, was very proud indeed.</p>
<p class='c006'><b>Questions to help the pupil understand the
picture.</b> Where did Sir Edwin Landseer first
see this dog? What did the dog do that pleased
the artist very much? Who suggested that he
paint this picture? why? Why was Mr. Smith
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>surprised? What was the dog’s name? Where
did Paul Pry go to have his picture painted?
Tell about Sir Edwin Landseer’s studio. How
did Paul Pry behave? Where was he lying when
the artist painted his picture? Where did Sir
Edwin Landseer imagine the dog to be? What
do you suppose made him think of that? How
do these dogs save people from drowning?
What makes you think there will be a storm?
What makes you think the air is sultry? What
time of day is it? Why did the artist call the
picture “A Member of the Royal Humane
Society”?</p>
<p class='c006'><b>To the Teacher</b>: Encourage the children to
talk about their own pet dogs, and to draw
pictures of them, using charcoal and manila
paper. The drawings will probably not be
worth much in themselves, but the practice
will make the children more observant, and will
tend to make their later drawings better.</p>
<p class='c006'><b>The story of the artist.</b> Sir Edwin Landseer
learned how to draw from his father, and when
he was but five years old he could draw remarkably
well. Edwin had three sisters and two
brothers who liked to draw, too. The family
lived out in the country and nearly every day
at breakfast the father would ask his boys,
“What shall we draw to-day?” They would
take turns in choosing, and sometimes they
would vote on it. Then out across the fields
the father and his boys would tramp until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>they came to where the donkeys, sheep, goats,
and cows were grazing. Each would choose
the subject he wished to draw, and the four
would sit down on the grass and begin to sketch.
Edwin’s first choice was a cow and his father
helped him draw it. After this Edwin came to
these fields every day and his father called
them “Edwin’s studio.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At this time Edwin had three dogs of his
own which he called Brutus, Vixen, and Boxer.
They were always with him and were so intelligent
that they seemed almost able to speak.
In the back yard the children had several pens
for pet rabbits and they kept pigeons in the
attic of their house. Once Mr. Landseer decided
to move. He selected a house, and
thought all was settled, when he discovered that
the landlord would not rent the house to him
because he kept so many dogs and other pets.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Edwin was only thirteen years old
two of his pictures were exhibited at the Royal
Academy. One was a painting of a mule and
the other was of a dog and puppies.</p>

<p class='c011'>Edwin painted always from real life, not
caring to make copies from the work of others.
All the sketches he made when he was a little
boy were kept very carefully by the father,
and now if you go to England you may see them
in South Kensington Museum in London.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>We read of how the father and his sons
made many visits to the Zoölogical Gardens,
where they could watch and make sketches of
lions, bears, and other wild animals. One day
they saw a strange sight in one of the store
windows in London—it was a Newfoundland
dog caring for a lion. The lion had been
caught in Africa when it was very little, and
had been cared for by this great Newfoundland
dog. They had never been separated, and now,
although the lion was much larger than the dog,
they were still the best of friends. Sometimes
the dog would punish the lion if it did not
behave, and the great beast would whimper just
as though it could not help itself. All three
boys made many sketches of this strange pair,
and could hardly be persuaded to leave the
window.</p>

<p class='c011'>Edwin, we are told, was a bright, gentle
little boy with blue eyes and light curly hair.
When he was fourteen years old he became a
pupil at the Royal Academy. The keeper there
was an old man. He grew very fond of Edwin.
He would look all around and if he could not
find him, would say, “Where is my curly-headed
dog boy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was only sixteen years old when he exhibited
his wonderful picture called “Fighting
Dogs Getting Wind.” A very rich man whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>praise meant a great deal at that time bought
this picture, and Edwin’s success was assured.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was about this time, too, that he painted
an old white horse in the stable of another
wealthy man. After the picture was finished
and ready to be delivered, it suddenly disappeared.
Search was made for it everywhere but
it was not found until twenty-four years afterwards.
A servant had stolen it and hidden it
in a hayloft. He was afraid to sell it, or even
to keep it in his home, for every one would
have recognized the great artist’s work.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Sir Edwin Landseer’s opinion that
animals understand, feel, and reason just like
people, and so he painted them as happy, sad,
gay, dignified, frivolous, rich, poor, and in all
ways just like human beings. This appealed
to the people very much and he became very
popular indeed. Every one knew of Landseer
and each wanted a certain one of his pictures
of dogs because the dog in it looked so much
like a dog they knew.</p>

<p class='c011'>For many years Sir Edwin Landseer lived
and painted in his father’s house in a poor
little room without even a carpet. The only
furniture, we are told, consisted of three cheap
chairs and an easel. But as his fame grew he
had more orders than he could fill, and before
long he was able to move into a fine studio near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Regent’s Park. It was here that he painted
the famous picture of Paul Pry. He was not
a very good business man and he left all his
affairs to his father, who sold his pictures for
him and kept his accounts.</p>

<p class='c011'>This story is told of Sir Edwin Landseer.
At an evening party, at which Landseer was
present, some one made the remark that no
one had ever been found who could draw two
things at the same time. Landseer quickly
replied, “Oh, I can do that; lend me two pencils
and I will show you.” In a very few minutes he
drew with one hand the head of a horse, at the
same time drawing a deer’s head with the other.
Both were so good that they might well have been
drawn one at a time and with much more effort.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although Landseer painted so many wild
animals, birds, and hunting scenes, he did not care
to hunt or shoot. His pencil was his weapon.
Sometimes he would hire a guide to take him
into the wildest places in search of game. To
the great surprise of his guide, instead of shooting
when a great deer came bounding toward
him, he would quickly make a drawing of it
in his sketch book. A beautiful live deer was
much more interesting to him than a dead one.
He said, “To shoot a bird is to lose it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Edwin’s brother Thomas made engravings of
nearly all of Edwin’s paintings, and so although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>we cannot afford to buy one of the paintings,
we can easily have one of the prints from the
engravings.</p>

<p class='c011'>No English painter has ever been more
appreciated and loved in his own country than
Sir Edwin Landseer.</p>

      <div class='line'><b>Artist</b>: Jean Geoffroy (zh[o˔]´frwā´).</div>
      <div class='line'><b>Birthplace</b>: Marennes, France.</div>
      <div class='line'><b>Dates</b>: Born, 1853; still living, 1918.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the picture.</b> In a little village
in Brittany, France, there is just such a school
as the one we see in this picture. We know this
is true because the artist, Mr. Jean Geoffroy,
lives near it and has told us all about it with
his brush and paints. We are told, too, that
he visits this school very often and has made
friends with all the boys and girls. He is a
very rich, generous man and besides painting
their pictures as large as life, he gives them
flowers, cakes, and candy. Although he is
naturally a very shy, quiet man, the children
never find him so when he is entertaining
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>If we could open the door very quietly and
go into this schoolhouse to-day, we should see
a scene just like that in our picture. In that
part of Brittany the children still wear those
queer bonnets, wide collars, and wooden shoes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Many of the children have come a long way to
school, for the houses are scattered. In some
parts of Brittany we should see built on the
low hills many an old castle, with its towers
and walls in ruin. Narrow little bridges cross
the streams which dash over the rocks on their
way to the ocean. Then there are the great
forests of oak trees where, long ago, the Druid
priests used to live and hold their mysterious
meetings, and about whose magic all kinds of
weird tales are told.</p>

<p class='c011'>But this was all so long ago that no doubt
the children think now only of the beautiful
fairies who live in the oak trees and go about
doing good. They may even steal quietly in
among the great trees, listening, and hoping to
hear the low knock of some fairy who will tell
them where to find the key which will unlock
the door and let her out—for that is the only
way one could hope to see a fairy in the daytime.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the school bell rings in the morning
the children come carrying their books and
their lunches—a gay little procession from far
and near, each wearing a quaint bonnet, dress,
and shoes like those you see in the picture.</p>

<p class='c011'>In our picture, school has begun, the opening
exercises are over, and the first class of beginners
is reciting. The little girl leaning against the
teacher is just learning to read, and points to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>each word as she pronounces it. She seems to
have come to a word she does not know. How
do you think she will learn it? Will she sound
it, or spell it and let some one in the class tell
her, or will the teacher tell her? The little girl
at this end holding her apron so tightly wants to
tell her—at least she looks as if she knew, and
so does the little girl looking at the book over
the child’s shoulder. But the girl looking out
of the window does not seem to be thinking of
her school work and we fear she will not know
her lesson.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tallest girl is probably reading in another
book and is farther advanced, for in country
schools they do not try to keep together, but
each one goes ahead as fast as he or she is able.
Perhaps that is one reason why the older girls
seated at the desks are studying so hard. No
doubt their lessons are much longer than ours,
for the school year is shorter. They must
work very hard if they would keep up with the
rest of the class.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two little children sitting beside the
teacher are too young to wear the queer bonnets
the others wear, or to sit on the high benches,
but they are content to be close to the teacher
and to listen to the older children with wonder
and admiration. They certainly do not look as
if they were six years old.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>What a pleasant face the teacher has! Look
at any part of the picture you wish and your
eyes will soon be drawn back to her face as
she sits in the bright light with the group of
children about her. This is what the artist
must have intended. It also explains why he
left so indistinct the faces and figures of the
pupils at their seats, and made the maps and
charts on the wall so vague. If we were to
stand in the doorway and look at the teacher
and her class, we should see the pupils in their
seats only as a blurred mass until we turned to
look directly at them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suppose the bell for recess should ring.
Then all would be commotion; but not confusion
we are sure, for it is easy to see that the
pupils in this school have been taught to be
orderly. We wonder if the two little ones will
be too shy to run and play with the other
children. Probably there is some older sister to
look after them.</p>

<p class='c011'>And what will the children play? They
probably do not have toboggan slides, seesaws,
swings, or basket-balls on their playgrounds, but
no doubt they play games like our “Follow the
Leader,” “London Bridge,” “Crack the Whip,”
and other games we like to play. It does not
seem as if they could run very fast in such
clumsy wooden shoes. If you have ever tried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>to wear a pair of Dutch wooden shoes you will
wonder how they could be worn in school, for
they are very likely to make a great deal of
noise on the wooden floor. But you can tell by
looking at this picture that all is very quiet in
the schoolroom.</p>

<p class='c011'>It will soon be time for the older girls to
recite, and then this beginners’ class can study.
Probably there are some smaller benches for
them on the other side of the room. We hope
the little girl who is looking out of the window
will work and not bother her neighbor, as that
big girl at the right-hand side of the picture is
doing. However, her neighbor keeps her eyes
on her book and pays no attention to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>We should like to visit this school, and, best
of all, we should like to go with these children
on their homeward journey across the narrow
little bridge, up the hill, past the great oak
forest, and across the fields.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Questions to help the pupil understand the

they differ? How are they alike? Which does

class is reciting now? Tell what each one of
the pupils is doing. Tell about the children
at the desks. Why must they study so hard?
What do you think they will all do at recess?
What makes you think this is a quiet, orderly
schoolroom? Look at the picture, then close
your eyes, and then open them slowly. Whom
do you see first? Whom do you think the

he paint the children in the background so
indistinct?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the artist.</b> Mr. Jean Geoffroy is
still living in this little village called Marennes,
near the school of which he has painted so many
pictures. He is very fond of children, and
counts them among his best friends. A large

are of children. He does not often paint the
children of wealth and fashion, preferring instead
to paint the little sons and daughters of
the poorer, hard-working people.</p>

      <div class='line'><b>Original Picture</b>: Luxembourg Gallery, Paris, France.</div>

      <div class='line'><b>Birthplace</b>: Gruchy, France.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>The story of the picture.</b> When the artist,
Jean François Millet, was a little boy he lived
in the country where nearly all the people knew
how to churn and make their own butter.
No doubt he often watched his grandmother
churn and helped her, too. He must have
liked to see her pour the milk into the big pans,
which she then set away in a cool place until
all the cream had come to the top. Then she
would skim the cream from the milk, put it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>into the big wooden churn, and begin to work
the churning rod up and down, up and down,
until her arms grew so tired that she was
glad to rest them a while and let him churn.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the end of the rod inside the churn are
two boards fastened crosswise which work the
cream into butter as the rod is moved up and
down. The churn in the picture has a cover with
a hole in the center for the handle, and as soon
as the cream begins to thicken some of it works
up with the rod to the top of the churn. We
can see it in the picture. This cream must be
what the cat smells and wants. If you have
ever watched a cat sniffing at something it
likes, you will know right away what the cat
in the picture is doing. She rubs against the
woman’s dress as a gentle reminder that she
is there, and would very much like to have
some cream. If the woman is called away for
a few moments she had better take the cat
with her or I fear Puss will not wait to be
served.</p>

<p class='c011'>A hen looks in at the open door, curious to
know what is going on. The woman continues
her churning. She must churn until the butter
comes, which may be in twenty minutes or an
hour, depending upon the condition of the cream.
Then the butter will be salted and prepared for
the table.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Many farmers now send their milk to the
creameries, where it is made into butter. In
these days of cream separators and machinery
of all kinds, buttermaking has ceased to be the
difficult task that it once was.</p>

<p class='c011'>Butter has not always been used for the
table as we use it now. We read that, long
ago, the Romans used it only as an ointment
and in medicine. The people of India used it
to anoint the wounds of their elephants. The
Greeks knew very little about it, and considered
its odor very disagreeable. One writer (Plutarch)
tells us of a visit which a great Spartan
lady paid to the wife of an important official,
when the one smelled so strongly of sweet ointment
and the other of butter that they could
not endure each other. People in those days
used olive oil in place of butter and this must
have satisfied their tastes as well as butter
does ours.</p>

<p class='c011'>This picture is often called “The Buttermaker.”
Like all of Millet’s pictures, it is a
picture of work. The woman looks strong and
capable, and willing to do each task as it comes
to her. Farther back in the room we can see a
bench upon which are placed the great jars of
milk. The stone floor and the half-darkened
room suggest a cool, comfortable place in which
to work on a hot summer day. The woman is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>dressed like all the French peasants, a handkerchief
wound around her head, and wearing those
wooden shoes which everybody wore, even the
little children. The broom resting against the
bench suggests another task when this one is
finished.</p>

<p class='c011'>The strong light in the left-hand side of the
picture must come from some window near by,
for that side of the woman’s face and dress, and
of the churn and handle, is brightly lighted.
Most of the woman’s face, however, is indistinct,
for Millet did not consider the features
important and usually painted his faces in
shadow. It is in what the men and women
are doing and how they do it that he wished to
interest us.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Questions to help the pupil understand the
picture.</b> How did Millet know so much about
churning butter? How did his grandmother
make butter? Describe the churn. What is
at the end of the rod inside the churn? What
can you see on the top of this churn? What
does the cat want? How does she ask for it?
How long must the woman churn? How is the
butter prepared for the table? Where is most
of our butter made to-day? How is it churned?
How did the Romans use butter? the people of
India? the Greeks? Tell about the visit of the
Spartan lady. What did people use instead of
butter? What is this picture sometimes called?
What are the figures in most of Millet’s pictures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>doing? How is this woman dressed? Why
did Millet paint most of her face indistinctly?
What did he consider important? Where does
the light come from?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>To the Teacher</b>: Have a child pose as if
churning. An ordinary pail or the waste-paper
basket with a broom or mop handle will do very
well for the churn. If possible, have the child
stand on a platform or table. The teacher’s
apron may be worn, but the idea is to represent
the action,—the bent head, curve of shoulders,
position of arms, and general feeling of the
figure. Use brush and ink for silhouette picture,
or charcoal and manila paper.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the artist.</b> It was not a very
long walk to the little village schoolhouse at
Gruchy where Jean François Millet studied.
His good old grandmother had taught him his
letters at home, and he could read and spell
very well before he ever went to school at all.
He was past six years old, and large for his age,
before he started. When he arrived at the school
yard the first thing he did was to fight. There
was a boy in the school who had fought every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>boy in the class, and proved that he was the
strongest. So when he saw Millet coming down
the street with the older children in whose care
he had been sent, this boy hurried toward him
and dared him to fight. Millet himself tells how
he came out victorious, and how proud the
older children were. “Millet is only six and
a half,” they said, “and he has beaten a boy
more than seven years old.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Millet was not a fighter, and fought
only when he was forced to. He loved to study,
and soon stood at the head of his class. When
the village priest offered to teach him Latin he
was only too glad to study evenings or at any
other time. At home he found little to read
except the Bible, which belonged to his grandmother;
even when he was very little she had
told him many wonderful stories from this
book. This Bible contained many pictures, and
one day he surprised her by making a drawing
from one of them. He drew his picture on the
wall of the house, with white chalk. She was
delighted, and so were his mother and father
when they saw the picture. After that he drew
many pictures of things in and about the house,
and of his grandmother, his brothers and sisters,
and his parents.</p>

<p class='c011'>As a boy Millet had to work in the fields
with his father and he had little time to spend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>on his drawings or his studies. In France it is
the custom among the peasants to spend an
hour every day in rest. But Millet, instead of
sleeping during that hour, spent it in drawing
the homely scenes around him.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not until he was eighteen years old,
however, that he drew a picture which made
his parents decide he should become an artist.
This picture was of an old man bent over a
cane, whom Millet met as he was coming home
from church. He drew this with charcoal on a
stone wall, and people recognized it at once and
were very much pleased. His father said he
would take him to see an artist in the next
village to whom he would show some of Millet’s
drawings and find out whether he thought the
boy could become an artist. Millet took two
drawings with him. The first represented two
shepherds with their sheep, one shepherd playing
a flute, the other listening as he watched
the sheep nibbling the grass near by. The
second drawing was of a man giving bread
to a beggar at his door. When the artist
(Mouchel) saw these drawings he was amazed,
and at first would not believe Millet had drawn
them himself. He said that Millet would surely
be a great painter. This decided the matter,
and Millet became Mouchel’s pupil.</p>

<p class='c011'>Millet studied with the artist not quite two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>months when his father died, and he was obliged
to return home to take his father’s place on the
farm as best he could. But the people of the
village thought it was too bad for him to give
up his painting, and they determined to help
him. So they raised a sum of money for him
and sent him back to the artist to study, and
finally to the great city of Paris, France.</p>

<p class='c011'>At Paris he became the pupil of a fashionable
painter of that day. When he entered the
class, a green peasant boy, the other pupils
laughed at him, but when they saw his work
they admired it very much. However, they
did not care for the people he painted, for he
always pictured the poor French peasants whom
he knew and loved best. The very paintings
we prize so highly now were not appreciated
then, and it was not easy for Millet to sell them.
He was very poor until the last ten years of
his life. Then people began to give him the
honor and praise that he so much deserved.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then too with his increasing fame came
better financial conditions. In 1867 he received
a medal and the blue ribbon of the Legion of
Honor. Soon afterward the death of a dear
artist friend made Millet fall ill. He never recovered
his health and died a few years later.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Questions about the artist.</b> Who painted
this picture? How old was he when he started
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>to school? Tell about his first day at school.
How did he get along at school? What did
he study with the priest? What did he read at
home? How did he surprise his grandmother?
Where did he draw his picture? What else
did he draw? Of whom did he draw a picture
as he was coming home from church? Why
must it have looked like the man? Where did
Millet’s father take him? What two drawings
did they take with them? What did the artist
think about these drawings? What did he say
about Millet? Why did Millet return home?
What did his neighbors do for him? Who
laughed at him in the city? How did they feel
when they saw what he could do? Why could
he not sell all his pictures? When were they
appreciated? Why are they so valuable now?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the picture.</b> One glance at
this picture tells us what has happened, and
why the little girl looks so serious. On her
arm she carries a quaint old pitcher which she
has just broken. It looks as though she were
dressed for a party, for there are flowers in her
hair, a bouquet on her dress, and flowers in her
apron. Perhaps she had picked the flowers
and was getting the water so that she could
place the pitcher full of blossoms on the table.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>She may have gathered up all the broken
pieces in her apron, hoping that the pitcher
can be mended. We are sure that it must
have been a pitcher that she prized very
highly and hopes to save, for she still holds
it. But surely it is not customary to take
such a good pitcher to the fountain; a tin pail
or a jug would be so much safer. It must
be that there is company at her home. She
must have caught up the pitcher from the
table and hurried away, impatient to be back
with her friends. In her haste she may have
slipped and fallen. Now she must go home,
and they will all know what has happened.</p>

<p class='c011'>She stands still a moment, trying to think
how to tell them; she does not know just how
it did happen, or whether she was really to
blame or not. Had the board she stepped on
not been slippery, or the pitcher not quite so
heavy, and if she had not been in a hurry, all
would have been well. Of one thing she is certain—she
did not do it purposely. She wishes
she had brought an old pitcher or a pail; but
it is of no use to think about that now—the
mischief is done. And somehow we feel sure
she will not be punished or even scolded very
much.</p>

<p class='c011'>What a very pretty girl she is, with just
such a sweet face as the artist Greuze always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>loved to paint. In the original painting she
has blue eyes, light hair, pink cheeks, very
red lips, and her dress is white. In the background
we see the old stone fountain, the cool
water flowing in a steady stream from the
mouth of the rudely carved head. What interesting
tales that fountain could tell of the rich
and the poor who pass that way each day; of
the many little acts of courtesy and kindness it
has seen; of the thirsty, the wasteful and careless,
the happy and the sad people it has known
and served.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>To the Teacher</b>: Have the pupils illustrate
the story of the little girl going for water. Use
charcoal and manila paper.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the artist.</b> Jean Baptiste
Greuze was born at Tournus, France, in 1725.
When, as a small boy, he began to show decided
talent for drawing, his father was very much
disappointed. He wanted his boy to pursue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>some more profitable profession, for, as he
said, it was only the few who won fame and
wealth as artists; the rest starved.</p>

<p class='c011'>However, the boy persevered and finally was
permitted to study with an artist friend of the
family. This artist became much interested
in him, and when, some months later, he moved
to Paris, he persuaded the father to allow
Greuze to go with him. Here the study was
continued, Greuze receiving special instruction
in the painting of heads. His greatest delight
was in painting heads of children and of old
men, and “Greuze heads” soon became famous.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, too, he painted many pictures from
the Bible, and at one time he was ambitious to
become a historical painter. It was then he
went to Rome to study the paintings of the
famous masters there. His first painting to
bring him fame was “A Father Explaining the
Scriptures to His Family.” Our picture, “The
Broken Pitcher” is one of the best known and
most popular of his paintings.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Questions about the artist.</b> Who painted
this picture? Of what nationality was he?
Why did his father not want him to become an

his study? What did he paint most? what
other subjects?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the picture.</b> Probably we think
we know just how we look and yet I wonder how
many of us could tell it to an artist so plainly
that he would be able to paint our portrait.
Perhaps at best all we could tell him would be
that his picture did not look like us, though
without knowing why. But it is true that many
great artists have painted their own portraits,
and very good likenesses they are, too. In
some ways it ought to be easy, for as they are
their own models they can sit for their pictures
as often and as long as they wish.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Madame Lebrun had been planning for
some time perhaps to paint a portrait of herself.
Then, just as she was all ready and seated in
front of a long mirror, the door had opened
suddenly and in had come her little daughter.
With a hop and a jump she had thrown herself
into her mother’s arms. Then with her arms
still about her mother’s neck, she had happened
to think of the mirror, and half turning there
she had seen herself held close in her mother’s
embrace. Madame Lebrun realized at once
what a lovely picture it would make, and so
she began to paint it.</p>

<p class='c011'>How much they resemble each other! The
little girl’s name was Jeanne Julie Louise
Lebrun, and she must have been very lovely
indeed. Her mother tells us, “She was charming
in every respect. Her large blue eyes
sparkling with spirit, her slightly tip-tilted
nose, her pretty mouth, magnificent teeth, a
dazzling fresh complexion, all went to make
up one of the sweetest faces to be seen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not care to draw and paint as her
mother did, but she loved to write stories.</p>

<p class='c011'>How proud of her lovely mother she seems
to be! And indeed she ought to look proud,
and happy too, for perhaps there never was
a little girl more petted and loved. Imagine
how proud she must have felt that her mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>was such a great artist, and painted beautiful
pictures which every one admired and which,
with her pleasant ways, made her one of the
most beloved women in France.</p>

<p class='c011'>The light in the picture seems to come from
a window at the left-hand side and to fall
directly upon the faces of the mother and child.
So interested are we in them we do not realize
that there is no landscape background, only a
suggestion of a curtain or screen against which
the two faces stand out clearly. The mother is
dressed in white, the daughter in a blue which
matches her merry blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>To us these two can never grow sad or old,
and we are glad Madame Lebrun looked in her
mirror and gave us this beautiful picture.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Questions to help the pupil understand the
picture.</b> How did Madame Lebrun paint this
picture of herself? Who came running into the
room? Why do you think the mother was glad
she came? What made her think of painting her
daughter, too? What is the color of her daughter’s
hair? her eyes? What is the daughter’s name?
What did she like to do? What is the color of
her dress? of her mother’s? Why should she be
so proud of her mother?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span><b>The story of the artist.</b> Madame Lebrun
began to draw and paint when she was not as
old as the little daughter we see in the picture.
Her father was her teacher. One day when
she was only seven years old she surprised him
by drawing a picture of a man with a long
beard, which was so good that he said, “You
will be a great painter, my child, if ever there
has been one.” She always remembered this,
and when she was sent away to the convent to
school she drew just as much and as often as
she could. Her notebooks were full of drawings
which were so well done they were kept in
the convent to show to visitors.</p>

<p class='c011'>After she returned home she began to paint
in earnest. Her father had many artist friends,
and when they came to the house she loved to
sit quietly in a corner and listen to their talk
about great pictures and artists. It was not
very long before she was painting pictures
which brought her great praise and honor.
About this time her father died, and later on
her mother married again. The stepfather
was a rich man, but he was very stingy, and
insisted upon her giving him all the money she
earned. By this time her fame had spread
over the country, and people came from far and
near to have her paint their portraits.</p>

<p class='c011'>She married a man who was a picture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>dealer and who, although she had not known
it, was a reckless gambler. She was obliged to
give him most of the money she earned to pay
his debts. After a time she left him, taking
her lovely little daughter with her. She had
a studio of her own where she could work,
and entertain her friends, and there she lived
and worked very happily with her little
daughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>One evening Madame Lebrun went to the
theater and when the curtain went up, there on
a large easel on the stage was one of her paintings.
When the people saw it they all stood
up and waved and cheered while they looked
toward the artist, who was seated in a box.
Madame Lebrun was so surprised she almost
forgot to smile and bow to them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The king and queen sent for her to come
and paint their portraits. Day after day the
royal carriage would come to take her to the
palace to paint the queen, Marie Antoinette,
and her children. Those were happy days
for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>A very short time after this picture was
painted the dreadful French Revolution broke
out. The poor people of France, who had
been treated very badly by the rich, rebelled
and tried to kill or drive away all the rich
people. Madame Lebrun had always been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>friends with the rich people, so it was not safe
for her to stay in Paris, either.</p>

<p class='c011'>One evening she dressed her little daughter
in a ragged dress and bonnet to make her look
like a poor peasant child. She herself wore
an old dress, with a handkerchief over her head
to hide her face like a veil. They slipped quietly
out of the house and into an omnibus that was
waiting for them and drove as quickly as possible
through the crowded streets, out of the
city. No one recognized them, and they went
to Italy, where they traveled about the country
for many years. Mother and daughter were
very popular and were entertained royally
wherever they went. But Madame Lebrun
never laid aside her painting. Even when she
was eighty years old she painted a beautiful
portrait of her little niece, who must have
reminded her of the little daughter in this
picture.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Questions about the artist.</b> What did
Madame Lebrun do when she was a little girl?
Who was her teacher? Of whom did she draw
a picture to surprise her father? What did he
say of it? What did this make her do? Why
were her notebooks treasured at the convent?
Tell about her stepfather. Tell what happened
at the theater. What king and queen sent for
her to paint their portraits? Why did she and
her daughter leave Paris? How did they escape?</p>

      <div class='line'><b>Original Picture</b>: Private Collection, W. H. Vanderbilt, New York.</div>
      <div class='line'><b>Artist</b>: Rosa Bonheur (b[o˔]´nûr´)</div>
      <div class='line'><b>Birthplace</b>: Bordeaux, France.</div>
      <div class='line'><b>Dates</b>: Born, 1822; died, 1899.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>The story of the picture.</b> After Rosa Bonheur
had painted horses, cows, and other tame
animals a great many times, she began to want
to paint wild animals, such as tigers and bears.
She could not go to the far-away countries
where they live, so she bought a lion and lioness
from a man who had been there. These she
kept in a very strong cage of heavy iron bars.
Here she came to watch them every day.</p>

<p class='c011'>This is one of the pictures she painted of
the lion. She called him “Nero,” and was so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>kind to him that after a while he became quite
tame. The lioness was always wild, but good
old Nero soon became so gentle that Rosa
Bonheur could pet him and even go into his
cage.</p>

<p class='c011'>How wise he looks! He seems to know the
great artist is painting his picture. No doubt
he could tell us wonderful stories of the
country he came from. He could tell us of the
big cave in the great rock where he lived, and
of that pool of water where he drank. Then
he could tell us of the tall, sweet-smelling
grasses and rushes in the jungles where he
could hide from his enemies and surprise them,
and how he walked about the marshes on
dark nights; for he can see at night as well
as in the daytime.</p>

<p class='c011'>One day Rosa Bonheur had to go away on
a long journey. She did not know just what
to do with the lions, but finally sent them to the
park, where a man took good care of them.
Nero did nothing but walk back and forth in
his cage all day long while his mistress was
away. He refused to eat anything the man
gave him, and by the time Rosa Bonheur
returned home the lion was very sick. As
soon as he saw her he showed how pleased he
was. She spent many days taking care of
him, and finally Nero was well again. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>never wanted any one else to come near him.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few months later, Rosa Bonheur had to
go away again. She was very much worried
about leaving Nero, but finally she found a
man with whom she was not afraid to trust
him. As soon as she was gone, however, gentle
old Nero became very cross and ugly. He
growled at the keeper, and tried to hurt him.</p>

<p class='c011'>One day the keeper had to go into the cage
to fix something. With a fierce growl Nero
sprang at him and tried to kill him. In the
struggle the lion was badly hurt. When Rosa
Bonheur came home she found Nero very sick
and going blind. No one dared to go near his
cage, but as soon as he heard her voice he was
the old faithful Nero again. When Rosa went
into his cage he put his great head in her lap
and seemed happy to have her pet him. Every
one was surprised to see how much he loved
her. Rosa Bonheur did everything for him she
could, hoping her pet would get well again,
but a few days later he died, his head in
her lap.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rosa missed her pet very much, and after
that she never cared to own another lion. She
gave the lioness to the city to keep in the park.
She was very glad she had painted so many
good pictures of Nero, for it made her feel as
if she still had her pet with her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span><b>Questions to help the pupil understand the
picture.</b> Whose lion was this? How did she
get him? Why did she want a lion? How
many did she have? How did the lioness
behave? What was this lion’s name? How
tame was he? Whom did he like best? What
happened when Rosa Bonheur went away on
a journey? Who took care of the lions? What
did Nero do? How did he act when Rosa
Bonheur came back? What did she do? What
happened the second time she went away?
upon her return? Why did Rosa Bonheur not
care to have another lion? Why was she glad
she had painted this picture?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>To the Teacher</b>: The children may draw a
picture of a lion. Use manila paper and charcoal.
Call attention to the large, bushy head,
cat-like body, and long, waving tail.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the artist.</b> Rosa Bonheur’s
father was an artist, and when any one asked
her who taught her to draw, she always said,
“My father taught me.” Her mother could
play the piano very well indeed, but Rosa did
not care so much for that study. When Rosa
was sent to school she had to walk some distance
through the woods to the schoolhouse.
Sometimes she would stop and smooth the dust
in the road with her hand, and then draw pictures
in it. She used a stick to draw with.
Even then she liked to draw pictures of animals
best of all. Often she had such good times
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>drawing that she even forgot to go to school.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father thought he could make a better
living in Paris, so the family moved to that
great city. The first place they lived was
up several flights of stairs and across the
street from a butcher’s shop. This shop had
for a sign a wild boar rudely carved out of
wood. Rosa missed her old pets so much, and
this wild boar looked so much like her little pet
pig in the country, that she used to stop to pat
the wooden boar every time she passed that way.</p>

<p class='c011'>A man who lived in the same house with
the Bonheur family kept a small school for
boys. Rosa’s two brothers went to this school,
and after a while the teacher said Rosa might
go too. She was the only girl in the school, but
she did not mind that at all. The boys were glad
to have her with them, for she knew more games
than they and played just like one of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father did not do so well with his painting
as he had hoped, so they moved into a
cheaper house. It was here that Rosa’s mother
died. The little sister, Juliette, was then sent
to her grandmother, and Rosa went to live with
an aunt. The aunt sent her to school, and it
was at this time that she used to stop on
the way to the schoolhouse to draw pictures
in the dust on the road. So she did not get
along very well with her aunt and the teacher
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>and was delighted when her father told her
she might come home.</p>

<p class='c011'>All the children loved animals, and there
are a great many stories told about those that
were kept in their house. Rosa’s brother
Isidore had a little lamb which he would carry
down six nights of stairs every morning, so that
it might nibble the green grass and be out in
the fresh air. It became a great pet, and all
the children drew its picture in ever so many
different positions. Besides the lamb, they had
a parrot, a monkey, two dogs, rabbits, and birds.
Their father let the children keep these pets in
a room fitted up especially for them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rosa’s father was teaching in a private
school at this time, and was away from home
all day; but when he came home at night Rosa
would show him what she had been doing
while he was gone. Once she had been painting
cherries, and her father came in while she
was working on them. He praised her very
much, and helped her finish the painting.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the evening Rosa and her two brothers
and her father used to put their easels in different
parts of the big room and draw and paint until
it was quite late. They would all much rather
do this than anything else in the world, and it
was the only time their father had in which to
help them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>The father belonged to a religious order
called the “Saint Simonians.” The members
wore queer gowns and bonnets with long tassels.
Rosa wore such a bonnet with a big tassel, and
sometimes the boys would shout and laugh at
her, but she paid no attention to that.</p>

<p class='c011'>Later the father got a position in another
private school, earning enough to send his three
children there as pupils and to give them everything
they needed at home.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rosa did not behave very well in school.
She liked to cut queer figures out of paper,
figures that looked like some of the teachers or
pupils. Then she would fasten them to a
string, put some moist bread on the other end,
and throw it up to the ceiling of the schoolroom.
The bread would stick to the ceiling and there
those dreadful figures must dangle until some
one came with a ladder and took them down.
She was punished very often, and sometimes
to make her behave she was given nothing to
eat but bread and water.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although she did such things every one
liked her, for she was good-hearted and kind
and full of fun. But finally she did something
that could not be overlooked. This is
what she did. The lady who kept the school
was very fond of flowers, and above all
she loved the stately hollyhock. She had a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>beautiful bed of hollyhocks in the front yard
of the school that was very much admired
by all who passed.</p>

<p class='c011'>One day when Rosa had been reading in
her school history about a war, she thought it
would be fine fun to arrange a great battle in
the yard between the girls. They used wooden
sticks for swords. Very soon Rosa’s side drove
their enemies toward the hollyhock bed, where
they turned and fled. Seeing the hollyhocks
standing guard like soldiers, Rosa thought it
would be fun to charge upon them, which she
did, cutting off all their heads. Is it any
wonder she was sent home in disgrace?</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father then sent her to a dressmaker to
see if she could learn that trade, but Rosa did
not like dressmaking, and finally went home
without having learned very much. Then
some friends gave her some photographs to
color, and this she liked to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next Rosa was asked to teach drawing to
a girl who was some years younger than herself.
This girl lived in a beautiful home which
had a large gallery full of fine pictures. The
floor of this gallery was waxed, and after Rosa
had looked at the pictures the two amused
themselves by sliding on the waxed floor until
it was time for Rosa to go home. So her
father had to give up all idea of making her a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>teacher. He knew that the only thing to do
was to let her paint, for that she loved to
do and could do well.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rosa was willing to walk miles in all kinds
of weather, to sit hours in all kinds of uncomfortable
positions, and to go without food, in
order to draw a good picture of some animal.
Now she began her study of animals in earnest.
She went to all the country horse fairs, to
the slaughter houses, and everywhere she could
to study them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rosa never had very pretty clothes. She
tells us herself that one day a parrot called
after her, “Ha, ha! That hat!” Now that
she was grown up she found she could not get
about very easily in her long skirts. There
were so many rough men in the packing houses
and other places she must go to study that
she got a permit to wear men’s clothing. Her
hair was short anyway, and so with her blue
working blouse and dark trousers she looked
just like a man. Then no one noticed her as
she went about, for they thought her only one
of the workmen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her pictures became famous the world over.
The first she exhibited was one of some little
rabbits nibbling carrots. From all over the
country she received gifts of fine horses and
other animals for her to paint. Buffalo Bill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>once sent her two fine horses from Texas. She
bought a farm, and had a large barn built where
she could keep her animals. How proud her
father was of her!</p>

<p class='c011'>One day as she was working hard in her
studio a servant came to tell her that the
Empress Eugénie had come to see her. It was
a great event when this royal lady came to the
artist’s studio, and there was Rosa dressed in
her old blue blouse covered with paint! She
did not have time to slip it off, even, before the
empress came in. They had a most delightful
visit, however, and as the Empress Eugénie
bent over and kissed Rosa Bonheur, she pinned
the Cross of the Legion of Honor on the artist’s
blue blouse. Rosa did not notice it until after
the empress was gone. How pleased she must
have been, for she was the first woman to
receive that high honor.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the picture.</b> This quaint little
Penelope Boothby, sitting so prim with her
queer cap and black silk mitts, looks as if she
knows a secret that pleases her very much.
Perhaps that dress she is wearing is long, and
she is pretending she is some great lady who
has just come to call upon the artist, Sir Joshua
Reynolds. It must have been fun to walk
about his great yard, with her long dress sweeping
over the soft green grass. It looks as if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>the artist had lifted her into the window of
his studio, and painted her as she sat there.
The half mischievous look on her face makes
us think she will jump down and run out among
the trees at any moment. We wonder what
makes her look so pleased.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps Sir Joshua Reynolds is telling her
a story—maybe the one about his father.
He lived in the country and one day decided to
go to town on horseback. It had rained very
hard, and the roads were muddy, so he wore
high-topped boots. These boots were a little
large for him, and as he rode along, swinging
his feet, for he was riding bareback, one of his
boots fell off. He was thinking of other things,
and did not miss his boot until he rode into
town and wanted to go into the store. Imagine
how he must have felt when he discovered his
loss.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“One boot on and one boot off,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>How the neighbors laugh and scoff;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Such an absent-minded man</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Ne’er was seen since the world began.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Or perhaps Sir Joshua was telling her about
his friend, the sea captain named Admiral
Keppel, with whom he took that wonderful
trip across the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>But best of all she would like to hear the
story of that strange little Italian boy he met
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>in Rome. One day a little fellow had offered
to be Sir Joshua Reynolds’s guide about the
great city. He was so small, ragged, and dirty
that Sir Joshua gave him some money and told
him to run away. But the little fellow smiled
happily, showing all his white teeth; his dark
eyes fairly danced, he was so eager to show the
artist what a good guide he could be. All that
day he followed Sir Joshua, and as he had lived
in Rome all his life, he knew all about the
city and could tell the great painter many interesting
things.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next morning Sir Joshua found the
boy sitting on his doorstep waiting for him.
He let the little fellow carry his paints and
brushes, and off they started. And so it happened
every day, until finally one day Sir
Joshua gave the boy an easel, and some paints
and brushes, and taught him how to paint.
And oh, how pleased the little boy was then!
He had a very strange name. It was Giuseppe
Marchi. After he had been with Sir Joshua
Reynolds a week you would hardly have
recognized the boy, dressed in a fine new suit
of clothes the artist had bought for him,
and painting pictures which were very good
indeed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the time came for Sir Joshua to start
for home; but Giuseppe Marchi was not to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>left behind. At that time Sir Joshua was not
a very wealthy man, and when they were still
three hundred miles from Paris he counted
his money and found he had only enough to
pay his own fare; so he had to say good-by
to poor Giuseppe Marchi. In Paris, Sir Joshua
had a good friend with whom he could stay.
Imagine his surprise one morning to find Giuseppe
Marchi sitting on the doorstep of this
friend’s house! The boy had walked all those
miles, and had at last found his dear master.
So then of course Sir Joshua brought him on
home with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps, just when Sir Joshua was telling
Penelope this part of the story, Giuseppe
Marchi himself came into the room, for he
lived with the artist all the rest of his life,
and helped him paint part of his pictures, too.
Sir Joshua Reynolds spoke of him as “an angel
sent from God to help me do my work.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When the artist painted this picture little
girls must have worn caps like this, for we see
them in some of his other pictures, too. They
were called “mob caps.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Nearly a hundred years after this picture
was painted a great party was given in London
for the children. All were to wear fancy dresses
to represent some person of whom the rest
should guess the identity. One little girl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>dressed as “Penelope Boothby.” She had a
cap just like this one, a handkerchief worn like
this, and a pair of black silk mitts. Every
one knew at once whom she represented, and
she was so much admired that the next day she
was taken to another great artist, Millais.
He painted a beautiful picture of the little girl
holding some cherries in her hands, and called
his picture “Cherry Ripe.”</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Questions to help the pupil understand the
picture.</b> What is this little girl’s name? What
do you suppose she has been playing? Where
is she sitting? why? What stories could Sir
Joshua Reynolds tell her? Tell the story of
his father and the high-topped boots; of the
little Italian boy. Why did Sir Joshua send
the boy away at first? What did the boy do
for Sir Joshua? What happened the next
morning? What did they do every day after
that? What did Sir Joshua teach the boy to
do? What made the boy look so different
after a week? When Sir Joshua started home,
what did the boy do? Why could he not go
all the way? How did he manage to follow
the artist? What did Sir Joshua do for the
boy then? Where was the boy when Sir
Joshua Reynolds was telling this story? How
did the artist often speak of this Italian boy?
Why do you think Penelope Boothby would
like to hear this story? Does she look as if
she were listening, or talking? Why do you
think you would like to know her?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span><b>To the Teacher</b>: Ask a little girl to pose
as Penelope Boothby. She may be seated
upon a table and drawn side view. Other pictures
may be drawn illustrating the story of
a little girl dressed in a long dress and walking
proudly among the trees; or of the artist and
his little Italian guide. Use manila paper and
charcoal. Work for action.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the artist.</b> When Sir Joshua
Reynolds was a little boy it was decided that
he should become a doctor. His father and
mother set their hearts upon it, and resolved
to help him in every way. Though he loved to
draw, it did not seem then as if he would
ever become an artist, for his five brothers and
sisters could all draw better than he. The
children used so much paper and so many
pencils that finally the father told them they
might draw upon the whitewashed walls in the
hall of their house. They used burnt sticks for
pencils. It must have been quite as much fun
as to draw with white chalk on the blackboard.</p>

<p class='c011'>Little Joshua’s drawings were so funny that
the older children always laughed when they
saw them and called him the clown. But he
did not care; he just kept on drawing until
one day he drew a picture which was really
very good. It was of their schoolhouse and
he drew it with a pencil on paper. It was so
well drawn that every one praised it, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>was very proud indeed. He was only seven
years old, and this praise pleased him so much
that he kept thinking of it all the time. That
day at school he covered his number paper
with drawings of things about the room.
His father taught the school, and you can
imagine how he felt when his son handed in a
paper which he could not read because of the
drawings all over it. He began to fear Joshua
would never make a good doctor or business
man, so he wrote at the top of the paper, “Done
by Joshua out of pure idleness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>One day a man came to their town who could
draw any person’s picture while he waited.
Then, too, he could cut a silhouette picture or
side view of the face out of black paper.
Joshua followed him about all day, and the two
became great friends. The artist gave Joshua
lessons and the boy soon learned to draw as
well as his teacher. We are told that it was
through the friendship of this strolling artist
that a rich man’s attention was called to
Joshua’s wish to be an artist, and this rich
man finally persuaded the father to let Joshua
go to London to study.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was about this time, too, that while at
church he drew a picture of the minister on his
thumb nail. From this tiny sketch he painted
a large portrait on a piece of sail which he found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>on the river bank near an old boathouse. His
paints were some the sailors used to paint their
boats. When his father saw this portrait,
which was so very like the minister, he knew
that his son would surely be a great artist,
and he gave up all thought of trying to make a
doctor of him.</p>

<p class='c011'>In London, Reynolds studied painting in
earnest, and wrote home, “While I am doing
this, I am the happiest creature alive.” He
painted the portraits of several well-known
men, and soon became very popular.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then came Admiral Keppel and the wonderful
voyage on the ship which he commanded.
Upon Sir Joshua’s return home he painted a
fine portrait of his friend, the Admiral, which
every one wanted to see many times.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not long before Sir Joshua Reynolds
became a rich man, and bought a beautiful
home with a large yard full of beautiful trees.
His sister came to keep house for him, and later
his little niece Offy came to live with him. He
loved children dearly, and always kept pets
and playthings for them. He entertained them
so happily that they always wanted to come
to see him.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Questions about the artist.</b> What did Sir
Joshua Reynolds’s father and mother want
him to be when he grew up? How many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>brothers and sisters did he have? How did
his drawings compare with theirs? Why did
they not draw with paper and pencils? Where
were they allowed to draw? What did they
call Joshua? Of what did he make his first
good picture? What did people say about it?
How old was he then? How did he spoil his
number paper? What did his father write at
the top of his paper? Tell about the strolling
artist and what he did for Joshua. Tell about
Joshua’s portrait of the minister. What did
his father decide after seeing this portrait?
What else did Sir Joshua Reynolds do? Tell
about his house and yard. What kind of
pictures did he paint? Why do you think
he was considered a great artist?</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Studying the picture.</b> Several days before the lesson is to
be taken up, the picture to be studied should be placed where
every pupil can see it.</p>

<p class='c011'>First of all, the children should find out for themselves
what is in the picture. The questions accompanying the
story of each picture are intended to help them to do this.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Language work.</b> The pupils should be encouraged in class
to talk freely and naturally. In this way the lesson becomes
a language exercise in which the pupils will gain in freedom
of expression and in the ability to form clear mental images.</p>

<p class='c011'>If a lesson does not occupy the entire drawing period, the
children should be asked to retell the story of the picture.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Dramatization and drawing.</b> Most of the stories told by the
pictures lend themselves readily to dramatization and, whenever
practicable, such stories should be acted out. The stories
also offer numerous interesting situations that may be used
as subjects for drawing lessons.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The review lesson.</b> The review lesson should cover all pictures
and artists studied throughout the year. At this time
other pictures available by the same artists should be on
exhibition.</p>

<p class='c011'>The review work may be conducted as a contest in which
the pictures are held up, one at a time, while the class writes
the name of the picture and the artist on slips of paper which
have been prepared and numbered for that purpose. One
teacher who used this device surprised her class by presenting
those whose lists were correct with their choice of any of the
large-sized Perry pictures studied.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many teachers, however, will prefer to use this time for
composition work, although the description of pictures is often
given as an English lesson. Pupils may write a description of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>their favorite picture. In fact, the lessons can be made to
correlate with history, geography, English, spelling, reading, or
nature study.</p>

<p class='c011'>In any event the real purpose of the work is that the pupils
shall become so familiar with the pictures that they will recognize
them as old friends whenever and wherever they may see
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is hoped that acquaintance with the picture and the
interest awakened by its story will grow into a fuller appreciation
and understanding of the artist’s work. Thus the children
will have many happy hours and will learn to love the good,
the true, and the beautiful in everything about them.</p>
